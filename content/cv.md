      <td>TCR Variational Autoencoder</td>
      <td>
        This project at the UCL Cancer Institute was done as part of my BSc in Immunology, Infection and Cell Pathology.
        Here I developed a variational autoencoder for human T cell receptor (TCR) amino acid sequences and showed that mapping healthy and diseased (lung caner) patient TCR repertoires into the model's representation space showed detectable differences in TCR distribution.

      <td>
        In this summer internship project at the UCL Cancer Institute, I developed a convolutional neural network-based computer vision program that can take in various types of scientific image data and accurately output the numbers and locations of objects of interest (such as cells or worms) seen in the image.
